When building a website or application, many businesses immediately think of hiring an agency. But there's a powerful alternative: hiring a freelance developer.
Agencies typically carry overhead costs—offices, large teams, and admin fees. Freelancers can often deliver the same quality for a fraction of the price.
Working with a freelancer means you speak directly to the person doing the work. There's less chance for miscommunication or slow feedback loops.
Freelancers can adapt quickly to changes, scale the project scope up or down, and tailor timelines more easily than large agencies.
Many freelance developers specialize in specific tech stacks or industries, meaning you can find someone with deep experience in exactly what you need.
If you're looking for a modern, accessible, and high-performing website — working with the right freelancer might be the smartest move.
